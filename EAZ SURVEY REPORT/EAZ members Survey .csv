Open student Chapters Across Zambia in key Universities (offering economics or business related programs) and monitor progression. ,Consider the fees to be reasonable for students,(I propose a low fee like k100 to k150.).

For the professionals it can be according to income bracket. 

Push for an act of parliament to make it mandatory for Economists  related jobs e.g. working at Bank of Zambia  to be members of the institute.

 Open Branches in other key provinces for membership development focus and commitment (if their is no funding ,it can start under voluntary program).

 I do believe membership benefits can be enhanced by fostering collaboration & Knowledge -Sharing.

Recommendation for board appointments for members according to specialization is key to motivate loyal members.

 Optimizing industry events ,more presence and engagement digitally, encourage discounts for early membership payments.eg 5% if they members pay before time

Continuous provision of education resources on Zambia economy and proposed reforms .

Push for members to make payment towards building own offices for a period of 2 years and provide minimum amounts according to membership structure."
